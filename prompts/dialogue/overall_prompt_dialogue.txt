You will be given a conversation between a human user and an automatic system. The dialogue consists of alternating turns, one per line, with each line starting with the speaker.

Your task is to rate the overall quality of the dialogue, considering both human inputs and system responses. Provide only the final score as an integerâ€”do not include summaries or conclusions.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Overall Quality (1-5): The dialogue should be coherent, engaging, and contextually relevant.
    - Logical Flow: Turns should connect naturally without contradictions or abrupt shifts.
    - Context Awareness: Responses must be relevant and appropriately continue the discussion.
    - Engagement & Naturalness: The dialogue should feel fluid, dynamic, and free from robotic or repetitive phrasing.
    - Credibility & Informativeness: Responses should provide meaningful and well-formed contributions.

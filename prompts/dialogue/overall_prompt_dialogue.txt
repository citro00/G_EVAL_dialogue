You will be given a conversation between two individuals: a human user and an automatic system. The dialogue consists of alternating turns of speech, one per line, with each line starting with the speaker.

Your task is to rate the system responses based on one metric. Provide only the final score as an integerâ€”do not include summaries or conclusions.

Evaluation Criteria:
Overall Quality (1-5)

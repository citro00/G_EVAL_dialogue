Evaluate the quality of system responses in a human-machine dialogue according to the following criterion:

Criterion: Overall Quality (1-5). Responses should maintain logical flow, context relevance, and stimulate engagement. They must be fluid, credible, and avoid contradictions, repetition, or mechanical phrasing. Responses should connect meaningfully to the conversation and encourage further interaction.

Your Task:

1 Generate a step-by-step evaluation process (CoT) for the dialogue, focusing strictly on the criterion.
2 Write only the detailed evaluation steps. Avoid summaries, conclusions, or scores.
3 Ensure all reasoning aligns with the criterion and avoid irrelevant details.

Output: List the detailed steps clearly.

The dialogue consists of alternating turns, one per line, with each line starting with the speaker.\nYou will then be given one potential response for the next turn in the conversation.\n\nYour task is to rate the response on one metric. Provide only the final score as an integer\u2014do not include summaries or conclusions.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\n- Overall Quality (1-5): The response should be coherent, engaging, and contextually relevant. \n    - Logical Flow: Response should connect naturally without contradictions or abrupt shifts.\n    - Context Awareness: Response must be relevant and appropriately continue the discussion.\n    - Naturalness: The response should feel fluid and free from robotic or repetitive phrasing.\n    - Credibility & Informativeness: Response should provide meaningful and well-formed contributions.\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n\nStep 1: Assess Coherence\nIs the response composed of clear and logical sentences that convey a single, unified idea? Does it build upon previous statements or add new insights to the discussion?\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Engagement\nDoes the response maintain the reader's attention with vivid descriptions, thought-provoking questions, or clever analogies? Are there any noticeable deviations from a flat tone that make the text more enjoyable and memorable?\n\nStep 3: Check Contextual Relevance\nIs the response directly related to the original topic or the preceding statements in the conversation? Does it address potential counterarguments or shed light upon unresolved issues without dominating the discourse with personal opinions or tangential ideas?\n\nStep 4: Measure Overall Quality\nBased on the results from Steps 1-3, score the response's overall quality using a rating scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), considering how well it achieves coherence, engagement, and contextual relevance within its purpose.\n\nConversation:\n\nuser: hola  \nsystem: hola. have you heard of the song \"hola \" by the band tamela  \nuser: no. should i check it out  \nsystem: yes, it's a great song. tamela is a spanish lyrical metal band  \nuser: I can't find it  \nsystem: they are a spanish lyric metal band that has been around for a while. do you like metal?  \nuser: no way  \nsystem: i'm sorry. they play some heavy metal music but they are so good and they are actually spanish, so they speak spanish with some metal influences.  \nuser: well i do like aluminuium  \nsystem: that's cool. aluminum is one of the elements that are formed from the elements.  \nuser: huh?
